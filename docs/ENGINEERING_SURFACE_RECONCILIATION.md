# Surface Reconciliation Contract

Before release, qualify the exact candidate against the actual Stellar Alert & Case Syslog interactive setup operator CLI/TUI.

- Launch the real CLI/TUI entry point in a disposable or lab-safe environment.
- Confirm documented command/menu names, prompts, defaults, help, cancellation behavior, and read-only/dry-run paths agree with the implementation.
- Exercise no destructive action without the explicit product safety confirmation path.
- Record candidate SHA, runtime environment, exercised surface, PASS/FAIL, and evidence location.
- Unit/static tests are supporting evidence only and cannot substitute for this operator-surface check.

## Engineering System User Acceptance v2 — mandatory execution semantics

- **ChatGPT itself is the executor and final auditor.** ChatGPT directly acts as the applicable real User/Operator/Admin persona and drives the actual supported public surface. Coding agents, alternate models, wrappers, scripted replays, CI jobs, unit/component/API suites, and static scanners are supporting evidence only and cannot produce Surface Reconciliation PASS.
- Start **capability-first and black-box-first**. The acting persona discovers the product from public help/navigation/controls/output before source/parser/route/test inspection. Implementation knowledge is auditor-only after the corresponding public evidence is frozen.
- Reconcile every applicable capability through public discovery, role/context, terminology, lifecycle, state/empty/error semantics, next action, recovery guidance, risky/destructive-action safety, and user-visible result. Every mandatory capability/public control receives an explicit disposition; FAIL/PARTIAL/BLOCKED/not-run never becomes PASS.
- **A finding is not a stop condition.** Preserve evidence and continue every safe independent scenario. Do not patch product/source/contract during the frozen discovery pass. After safe coverage is exhausted, freeze the complete finding set, remediate it as one bounded batch, and rerun Surface Reconciliation from the beginning on the new candidate.
- For CLI products, ChatGPT directly uses the actual supported public CLI/TUI; parser/unit tests, direct internal APIs, and scripted replay cannot substitute.
- Retain exact candidate HEAD, committed contract identity/digest, machine-readable capability/surface/findings ledgers, and a ledger-derived summary. Release PASS requires 100% applicable capability/public-surface coverage, zero mandatory FAIL/PARTIAL/BLOCKED, and zero unresolved blocking finding.
- If the product supports an AI-assisted public user path, run the same applicable user goal through that path using only user-visible information and require semantically equivalent supported guidance/outcome.
